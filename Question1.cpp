// Which of the following is true about selection sort:
// a) In each iteration we find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
// b) In each iteration we find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
// c) We swap the index of the minimum element with the first element of the array.
// d) It takes O(n^2) swaps.
// all are right but d is wrong as only o(n-1)swap done 
// as we have seen that in selection sort that we find minimum element and its index then we swap them with first element with the minimum index
// then we forward our loop which then led to sort the array it also take o(n^2)time complexity and (n-1)swap
